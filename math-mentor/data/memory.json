    "solution": "### 1. Understanding of the Problem\n\nThe problem provides two vectors, $\\mathbf{a} = (2, -1, 3)$ and $\\mathbf{b} = (1, 4, 2)$. The topic is linear algebra and the strategy is matrix operations. While the problem doesn't explicitly state what operation to perform, in the context of linear algebra with two vectors, common operations include vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, and cross product. Given the instruction to use \"matrix operations\", it implies we might need to represent these vectors as matrices or perform operations that can be viewed through a matrix lens. Without a specific question, I will assume the most common vector operation asked in conjunction with linear algebra and matrix operations is to find the dot product of the two vectors. The dot product of two vectors can be computed using matrix multiplication if the vectors are represented as row or column matrices.\n\n### 2. Step-by-Step Solution\n\nTo calculate the dot product of vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ using matrix operations, we can represent them as column matrices and perform matrix multiplication.\n\n**Step 1: Represent the vectors as column matrices.**\nLet $\\mathbf{a}$ be represented by a column matrix $A$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ be represented by a column matrix $B$.\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the dot product using matrix multiplication.**\nThe dot product of $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ can be calculated as $A^T B$, where $A^T$ is the transpose of matrix $A$. The transpose of a column matrix is a row matrix.\n$A^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nNow, perform the matrix multiplication:\n$A^T B = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nTo multiply these matrices, we multiply each element of the first matrix (the row vector) by the corresponding element of the second matrix (the column vector) and then sum the results.\n\n$(2 \\times 1) + (-1 \\times 4) + (3 \\times 2)$\n\n**Step 3: Perform the arithmetic operations.**\n$2 \\times 1 = 2$\n$-1 \\times 4 = -4$\n$3 \\times 2 = 6$\n\nNow, sum these values:\n$2 + (-4) + 6 = 2 - 4 + 6 = -2 + 6 = 4$\n\nAlternatively, we could represent $\\mathbf{a}$ as a row matrix and $\\mathbf{b}$ as a column matrix, or $\\mathbf{a}$ as a column matrix and $\\mathbf{b}$ as a row matrix for a different matrix operation that results in the dot product. The standard way to obtain a scalar (the dot product) from two vectors using matrix multiplication is to multiply a row vector by a column vector.\n\nLet's consider representing $\\mathbf{a}$ as a row vector and $\\mathbf{b}$ as a column vector.\n$\\mathbf{a}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\nDot product = $\\mathbf{a}^T \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2 \\times 1) + (-1 \\times 4) + (3 \\times 2) = 2 - 4 + 6 = 4$.\n\nOr, representing $\\mathbf{a}$ as a column vector and $\\mathbf{b}$ as a row vector (transpose of $\\mathbf{b}$), and then multiplying $\\mathbf{a}$ by $\\mathbf{b}^T$:\n$\\mathbf{a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$\\mathbf{b}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\nDot product = $\\mathbf{a} \\mathbf{b}^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -1 \\\\ 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$. This would result in a $3 \\times 3$ matrix, not a scalar dot product. The dot product is a scalar quantity.\n\nThe correct matrix operation to obtain the dot product is the multiplication of a row vector with a column vector.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ and $\\mathbf{b} = (b_1, b_2, b_3)$.\nThe dot product is $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3$.\n\nUsing matrix notation:\nRepresent $\\mathbf{a}$ as a row matrix $A_{row} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ as a column matrix $B_{col} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThen $\\mathbf{a} \\cdot \\mathbf{b} = A_{row} B_{col} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_1 & a_2 & a_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\end{pmatrix} = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + a_3 b_3$.\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$A_{row} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$B_{col} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nDot product = $\\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2)(1) + (-1)(4) + (3)(2) = 2 - 4 + 6 = 4$.\n\n### 3. Final Answer\n\nThe dot product of vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ can be computed using matrix operations as follows:\nLet $\\mathbf{a}$ be represented by the row matrix $A_{row} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ be represented by the column matrix $B_{col} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe dot product is then calculated by the matrix multiplication $A_{row} B_{col}$:\n$A_{row} B_{col} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & -1 & 3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 4 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix} = (2 \\times 1) + (-1 \\times 4) + (3 \\times 2) = 2 - 4 + 6 = 4$.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{4}$.",
